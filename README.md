## About how this repository works

The content of this repository gets build every time something is pushed to `main` and the github page will be updated accordingly. The build process is defined in the [publish github action file](.github/workflows/publish.yml).

The content of the website has been saved under the [`web_source` directory](./web_source). This directory was chosen as an example and it may differ in different repositories you may work with.
